App to help evacuate an office in case of emergencies.

## How does it work?
It's a 3 step process.
- Load XLSX - Load an excel file from your phone storage with details of employees who have checked into office that day.
- Scan QR codes from ID cards to mark employees as safe - you can keep track of employees who are unaccounted for.
- End evacuation

## Important Input formats

| -------------- | ----------- |
|       ABC      |     ID1     |
|       XYZ      |     ID2     |

- QR Code data, for example:

```json

  "Employee ID": "ID123",
  "Employee name": "Nightmare" 
}
```
